### Running Locally

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

#### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/immodi/technology-competition-app.git

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

    The project includes a `.env_example` file. To connect to your custom backend, create a `.env` file based on it:

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Do **NOT** add a trailing slash `/` at the end of the URL.

    Example `.env`:

    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8020
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
